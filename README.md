# Policy Patterns for Usage Control in Data Spaces

This repository complements the paper titled "Policy Patterns for Usage Control in Data Spaces". The work aims to contribute to the further development of automated contract negotiation and data usage policies in data spaces. 

## Repository Structure
1. *Collection of Policy Patterns in ODRL*: we have collected a set of policy patterns for usage control that are particularly relevant in the context of data spaces. These policy patterns capture common and recurring policy requirements and scenarios encountered in data sharing and governance.
2. *ODRL Profile*: This ontology proposes extensions to the ODRL vocabulary to accommodate the representation of data space-specific policies. The extension includes additional actions and operands that enhance the expressiveness of the ODRL vocabulary.
