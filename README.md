# Policy Patterns for Usage Control in Data Spaces

This repository complements the paper titled "Policy Patterns for Usage Control in Data Spaces". The work aims to contribute to the further development of automated contract negotiation and data usage policies in data spaces.

### *Collection of Policy Patterns in ODRL*
We have collected a set of policy patterns for usage control that are particularly relevant in the context of data spaces. These policy patterns capture common and recurring policy requirements and scenarios encountered in data sharing and governance.

* The policy patterns were classified based on their enforcement type:
   * Preventive Mechanisms are dynamic and proactive enforcement mechanisms that allow or prohibit requests for data usage, revoke access in case of policy violations, delay usage requests until obligations are fulfilled, update user or object attributes based on usage decisions, and execute actions like sending notifications to data owners.
   * Detective Mechanisms can be applied in situations where the usage control framework cannot enforce policy restrictions or prevent policy violations. Various detective mechanisms, such as auditing, logging, or user notifications, can be employed to provide evidence or indications of executed commands.
* The stakeholders involved in the implementation of each policy pattern were identified as providers, consumers, and third parties.
* For each policy pattern in the collection, the corresponding PIP and PAP/PDP is specified: the stakeholder responsible for deploying (PAP) and evaluating (PDP) the policy, and the stakeholder responsible for providing information about its fulfillment (PIP).
